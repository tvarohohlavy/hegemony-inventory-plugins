"""Platform services injected into providers at construction.

An out-of-tree provider never imports the platform's secret backends, SSRF policy, Git
cache, or settings. The core platform builds a :class:`PlatformServices` bound to the
request's DB session and the provider's id/type, and passes it to the provider. The
provider calls these methods instead of importing app internals; resolution, validation,
and Git transport all stay inside the platform.
